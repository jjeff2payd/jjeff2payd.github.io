			<h5>Jordan is a dreamer</h5>
			<p>I'm a student-athlete-founder from Palo Alto, California. Currently, I attend Yale University and major in Economics, while pursuing all things technological in my spare time. Innovation is the engine that powers the economy, competition the force that divides politics, and curiosity the spirit that sparks ingenuity.</p><br>
			<p>I still have a lot to learn but have no plans on stopping anytime soon</p>

			<h5>Motivation</h5>
			<p>I am motivated by a higher power that makes all things possible. It is this opportunity that drives us to build something beyond ourselves, to share with one another, to create what wasn't but will be. Now is the time to start a revolution, to be the change you want to see in the world. Our worth is not determined by what we have, but by what we can give back. Ultimately, I'd like to disrupt education because it is the key that unlocks all doors. Too many of us approach the world with an illusion of explanatory depth; as we grow old we stop asking ask why? or better yet why not? If we could only see the beauty in front of our eyes, I think we'd have a few more questions</p><br>

			<h5>Interests</h5>
			<p>I enjoy reality. But I prefer to dream in a world without walls, open infinite windows and always think differently. I am interested in entreprenuership, knowledge, and hummanity. If you think changing the world is impossible, you must have never heard about history. The goal is to throw my dreams into reality, and then go find them</p>
